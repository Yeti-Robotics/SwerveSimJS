# SwerveSimJS
=============
A repository for a JS project that shows we can program a swerve drive
# Currently:
- WS to modify forward/reverse vertexes
- AD to modify strafe vertexes
- QE to modify rotation vertexes
- arrow keys to modify bases position (test feature)
- ZX to modify bases rotation (test feature)

# TODO:
- Add limiters
- Check gamepad works
- Make movement (and maybe position) dependent on aggregation of vertexes
