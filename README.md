# SwerveSimJS
A repository for a JS project that shows we can program a swerve drive
=============
# Keyboard Controls:
- WS to modify forward/reverse vertexes
- AD to modify strafe vertexes
- QE to modify rotation vertexes
- arrow keys to modify bases position (test feature)
- ZX to modify bases rotation (test feature)

# Gamepad Controls:
- Back to reset
- Two modes, press left stick (and pray) to switch:
- First Mode (Movement Mode):
 - Left stick to move base
 - Right stick to rotate
- Second Mode (Vertex Mode):
 - Left stick to control X and Y vectors
 - Right stick to control rotation


# TODO:
- Make movement (and maybe position) dependent on aggregation of vertexes
- Display actual values to make look more "Mathy"
